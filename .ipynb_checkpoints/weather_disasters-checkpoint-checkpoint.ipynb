The precipitation caused ponding on roadways, and small stream and drainage ditch flooding.  Also, two hikers were killed in East Maui on the 27th, apparently after being swept over a falls along Waikamoi Trail into the sea.  The body of one hiker had been found as of this writing, but the other was still unaccounted for.  There were no significant damages reported.',\n",

Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jackson's area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds. Flash flooding also occurred across many areas leading to road closures. The severe weather and cold front finally cleared Mississippi by early Christmas evening.\",\n",

      " 'An anomalously dynamic upper level system caused a rare severe weather outbreak during the afternoon and evening hours of December 14th. This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front. ||Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.   ||As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads. ||Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot���s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).||As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0. ||By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.',\n",

From the 21st through 26th of December, heavy rain, gusty winds, flooding, and mudslides occurred across the Bay Area in these consecutive events. Downed trees, powerlines, and flooded roadways impacted residents over the Christmas holiday season.

The tornado quickly intensified as it approached the southwest corner of Holton, reaching EF1 to EF2 intensity. The path of the tornado moved nearly parallel to the north side of Highway 50 as it moved through Holton. Many of the homes and businesses east of Marion Street were damaged by EF2 intensity winds. The tornado then strengthened to low end EF3 intensity as it moved near the intersection of Highway 50 and Versailles Street. At this point, two fatalities occurred in a mobile home. Six injuries were also reported in the town of Holton. One of the individuals injured died many months later as a result of his injuries, bringing the total number of fatalities from this tornado to 3. This tornado then continued to the northeast from this point at high end EF2, low end EF3 intensity, damaging homes on Sleepy Road and Old Michigan Road. The tornado began to decrease in intensity east of Old Michigan Road and maintained EF1 intensity until it dissipated approximately one mile southeast of Osgood on Finks Road. Several homes and farms had minor damage along the track between Old Michigan Road and the end of the tornado track. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of this tornado was estimated at 145 miles per hour.',\n",
      " 'The tornado touched down in Grant County at 1623 EST, causing low to mid EF3 damage specifically in the Harvesters Subdivision. This damage occurred at the west end of Barley Circle. Most of the damage in the rest of the subdivision was EF1 to EF2. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of this tornado while in Grant County was estimated at 145 miles per hour. After traveling 1.33 miles on the ground in Grant County, the tornado then crossed into Kenton County at 1624 EST. Immediately as the tornado crossed west to east of Interstate 75, it strengthened to EF4 level. Five single family homes were destroyed down to their foundations in this area, with at least two of these homes having strapping or bolting to their foundations. The EF4 damage continued to the north end of Lexington Pike, where 2 homes and multiple outbuildings were completely destroyed. Both homes were brick structures with foundation bolting or strapping. The EF4 winds continued across Route 25 and ended near the Bagby Road area. At least 2 vehicles were carried, with one carried over 1800 feet. Trees were stripped of nearly all branches, with much of the bark also stripped. All 4 fatalities with this tornado occurred within the area of EF4 damage. As the tornado headed further to the east northeast, high end EF3 damage continued through other properties along Bagby Road, to Carlisle, Parker Grove, and Paxton Roads. Numerous double and single wide homes were destroyed, with both brick and siding structures left with collapsed exterior walls and either all or a large percentage of the roof removed. The tornado continued the east northeast path into southeast Kenton County, to the Licking River near Morning View. Damage in the Morning View area was consistent with EF1 to EF2 damage to near the Campbell County line, where the tornado lifted at 1632 EST after traveling 8.52 miles in Kenton County. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed from this tornado while in Kenton County was estimated at 175 miles per hour. This storm produced an earlier tornado in southern Indiana. Debris, possibly from that tornado, was later observed falling from the sky across Boone County, Kentucky.',\n",

The tornado then crossed into Pendleton County at 1641 EST after producing high end EF3 damage along Reid Ridge Road near the Campbell and Pendleton County line. The tornado then moved across Mays Road producing significant and widespread EF2 to low end EF3 damage. The tornado then crossed AA highway and eventually the Ohio River, after crossing Kentucky Highway 8. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of the tornado was estimated to be 160 miles per hour in Campbell County and 140 miles per hour in Pendleton County. The tornado traveled a total of 2.68 miles in Campbell County, and 4 miles in Pendleton County. The tornado then moved into Clermont County Ohio at 1646 EST, where it hit the town of Moscow, causing EF3 damage. The tornado continued on the ground across Clermont County, crossing into Brown County at 1658 EST. The tornado then lifted south of Hamersville in western Brown County at 1702 EST. This tornado caused extensive damage to structures and trees along its entire path on both sides of the Ohio River. Numerous homes were very heavily damaged or destroyed. Many homes lost their roofs, having complete exterior wall failure. Some modular homes were completely removed from their foundations, lifted, and thrown in excess of 100 yards where they were destroyed. The damage in Ohio from this tornado was consistent with maximum winds estimated at 160 miles per hour in Clermont County, and 100 miles per hour in Brown County. The tornado traveled a total of 11.04 miles in Clermont County, and 2.69 miles in Brown County.',\n",
