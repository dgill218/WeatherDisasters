The precipitation caused ponding on roadways, and small stream and drainage ditch flooding.  Also, two hikers were killed in East Maui on the 27th, apparently after being swept over a falls along Waikamoi Trail into the sea.  The body of one hiker had been found as of this writing, but the other was still unaccounted for.  There were no significant damages reported.',\n",

      " 'Hurricane Maria was a catastrophic category 4 hurricane which devastated the island of Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Maximum sustained winds of 175 mph as it was approaching the county warning area. The direction was towards the west northwest with the eye clipping Saint Croix and Vieques. The hurricane then made landfall in the municipality of Yabucoa in mainland PR at 6:15 am AST with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph. The center of the storm traversed diagonally through mainland Puerto Rico exiting across the northwest municipalities in the early afternoon hours. Extreme winds  were observed across most of mainland Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Saint Croix with catastrophic flooding observed across many areas in mainland Puerto Rico.||During a preliminary survey of areas along the path of Hurricane Maria���s center, it was evident that catastrophic damage had occurred. Maria���s strong winds spread large amounts of debris across the entire area. All full trees were defoliated, and those that were not, were snapped or uprooted by Maria���s strong winds and lost medium to large branches. During the interview process, stories and images were particularly similar. Numerous locals reported that they felt the ground and their houses shaking, while most were amazed by the force of the unprecedented strong winds that not only transformed their surroundings but also their lives. Although most structures across the island are built using concrete as the main material, countless homes and buildings sustained some type of structural damage. If not blown off, non-concrete roofs suffered some type of damage. Nearly all commercial signs, fences, and canopies were destroyed, including large digital high definition boards. The last time that Puerto Rico experienced a category 4 or stronger hurricane was back on 1928 with Hurricane San Felipe II.  Maria was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in mainland Puerto Rico since Hurricane Felipe II in 1928, a category 5 storm. |The NOAA estimate of damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to Maria is 90 billion dollars.||Death toll from hurricane Maria at the moment of this report is highly uncertain. The official number stands at 65 deaths. 20 of these deaths occurred during the hurricane. The other 45 deaths occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. From these 45 deaths, there were four (4) people which died due to heart attack,  three (3) due to lack of respiratory aid and three more (3) people due to lack of medical supplies. In addition two (2) deaths were due to suicides. One person (1) died when a tree fell over his car while driving. As of late November 2017, there were three (3) confirmed deaths from leptospirosis. One person (1) died during hurricane preparations. One women (1) died when she fell from her wheel chair. Her house was flooded, and she drowned.|The reasons of the remainder of the deaths are unknown at the moment of this publication.',\n",

The line intensified as it approached the Mississippi River and caused wind damage and tornadoes. As the convective system evolved into Mississippi, numerous tornadoes developed along the advancing line, with the most prolific damage occurring along the track of a large meso-scale convective vortex (MCV). This feature tracked roughly from Claiborne County through western Hinds/Madison, eastern Yazoo, eastern Holmes, southeastern Carroll, Montgomery, and northwestern Webster counties. This corridor is where the most significant damage occurred, as well as one fatality. Flash flooding, hail, and other wind damage occurred as these storms moved through.',\n",

The storm then weakened to a tropical storm and slowed,  looping back and tracking over SE Texas then back over the Gulf of Mexico making a second landfall along the Louisiana coast during the early morning hours of August 30th. Over that 5 day period over Southeast Texas TS Harvey produced catastrophic flooding with a large area of 30 to 60 inches of rain, 23 tornadoes, tropical storm force winds and a moderate storm surge near Matagorda Bay.  In some of the heavier bands rain fell at a rate of over 5 inches per hour. This copious record amount of rain over a  led to catastrophic flooding. Thousands of homes, businesses, and roads were flooded due to flash flooding and sheet flow from long duration intense rain. Main stem rivers and adjoining tributaries, creeks and bayous reached full capacity and came out of their banks and this also contributed to the massive flooding across southeastern Texas.',\n",

After the initial landfall, the cyclone moved back into the gulf a couple days later and then made another landfall in Southwest Louisiana during the morning of the 30th. The first rains from the system moved across the region during the afternoon of the 25th and finally ended during the morning of September 1. One to 5 feet of rain fell across Southeast Texas during the week which in some cases was slightly more than a normal yearly rainfall total. Widespread flooding occurred and a new rainfall record was set regarding the total for a tropical cyclone in the United States.']\n",
