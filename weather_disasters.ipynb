      "Harvey made landfall as a category 4 hurricane near Rockport, Texas during the evening of August 25th. The storm then weakened to a tropical storm and slowed,  looping back and tracking over SE Texas then back over the Gulf of Mexico making a second landfall along the Louisiana coast during the early morning hours of August 30th. Over that 5 day period over Southeast Texas TS Harvey produced catastrophic flooding with a large area of 30 to 60 inches of rain, 23 tornadoes, tropical storm force winds and a moderate storm surge near Matagorda Bay.  In some of the heavier bands rain fell at a rate of over 5 inches per hour. This copious record amount of rain over a  led to catastrophic flooding. Thousands of homes, businesses, and roads were flooded due to flash flooding and sheet flow from long duration intense rain. Main stem rivers and adjoining tributaries, creeks and bayous reached full capacity and came out of their banks and this also contributed to the massive flooding across southeastern Texas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            400\n",
      "A relatively dry October 2013 through early February 2014 period with precipitation running around only 50 percent of normal turned unusually wet one week into February and continued through March. Precipitation during February and March ranked in the top 10 all-time for this time period, running between 150 and 200 percent of average. ||On a warm and dry 22nd of March, 2014, a large landslide occurred four miles east of the town of Oso, Washington. The slide debris, traveling at over 60 miles per hour, crossed the entire river valley, covering an area of over a square mile with an approximate deposit thickness of 15 to 75 feet in some areas. The force of the slide flow caused 43 fatalities, 12 injuries, destroyed 37 homes, and wiped out SR 530 for over a mile. In addition, the slide debris completely blocked the North Fork Stillaguamish River for over 24 hours, backing up a pool of water that flooded the valley about 2 miles upstream and reached approximately 20 feet deep, inundating an additional 6 homes. The cause of the slide is not fully known, though precipitation in the previous months to years contributed to the ground failure. A rain gage located 2 miles west of the slide had 19.93 inches of rain in the 40 days leading up to the slide. |As of March 19th the nearest reporting station Arlington, had reported 7.14 inches of rain, which is about 2 inches shy of the record 9.23 for the entire month of March.  Three days before the slide, the area received close to an inch of rain in one day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  172\n",
      "Harvey moved across the Gulf of Mexico into the central Texas Coast during the last week of August. After the initial landfall, the cyclone moved back into the gulf a couple days later and then made another landfall in Southwest Louisiana during the morning of the 30th. The first rains from the system moved across the region during the afternoon of the 25th and finally ended during the morning of September 1. One to 5 feet of rain fell across Southeast Texas during the week which in some cases was slightly more than a normal yearly rainfall total. Widespread flooding occurred and a new rainfall record was set regarding the total for a tropical cyclone in the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         128\n",
      "On the evening of Friday, December 10, 2021, a potent storm system moving across the central United States resulted in significant long-track tornadoes. A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  112\n",
      "Hurricane Maria was a catastrophic category 4 hurricane which devastated the island of Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Maximum sustained winds of 175 mph as it was approaching the county warning area. The direction was towards the west northwest with the eye clipping Saint Croix and Vieques. The hurricane then made landfall in the municipality of Yabucoa in mainland PR at 6:15 am AST with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph. The center of the storm traversed diagonally through mainland Puerto Rico exiting across the northwest municipalities in the early afternoon hours. Extreme winds  were observed across most of mainland Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Saint Croix with catastrophic flooding observed across many areas in mainland Puerto Rico.||During a preliminary survey of areas along the path of Hurricane Maria���s center, it was evident that catastrophic damage had occurred. Maria���s strong winds spread large amounts of debris across the entire area. All full trees were defoliated, and those that were not, were snapped or uprooted by Maria���s strong winds and lost medium to large branches. During the interview process, stories and images were particularly similar. Numerous locals reported that they felt the ground and their houses shaking, while most were amazed by the force of the unprecedented strong winds that not only transformed their surroundings but also their lives. Although most structures across the island are built using concrete as the main material, countless homes and buildings sustained some type of structural damage. If not blown off, non-concrete roofs suffered some type of damage. Nearly all commercial signs, fences, and canopies were destroyed, including large digital high definition boards. The last time that Puerto Rico experienced a category 4 or stronger hurricane was back on 1928 with Hurricane San Felipe II.  Maria was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in mainland Puerto Rico since Hurricane Felipe II in 1928, a category 5 storm. |The NOAA estimate of damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to Maria is 90 billion dollars.||Death toll from hurricane Maria at the moment of this report is highly uncertain. The official number stands at 65 deaths. 20 of these deaths occurred during the hurricane. The other 45 deaths occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. From these 45 deaths, there were four (4) people which died due to heart attack,  three (3) due to lack of respiratory aid and three more (3) people due to lack of medical supplies. In addition two (2) deaths were due to suicides. One person (1) died when a tree fell over his car while driving. As of late November 2017, there were three (3) confirmed deaths from leptospirosis.

Roads and highways in and around Houston were flooded and therefore closed for long time periods. Catastrophic flooding occurred on nearly every one of the 22 watersheds in Harris County. 10 out of the 19 bayous in the county reached record crests and flooding. There was widespread flooding along Buffalo Bayou and upstream and downstream of both Addicks and Barkers Reservoirs due to record level pool elevations. There was major flooding of hundreds of homes within numerous neighboring subdivisions along the San Jacinto River and the East Fork of the San Jacinto River.|There were numerous water rescues within Houston and the surrounding suburbs. Roads and highways in and around Houston inundated and closed due to flash flooding. ||Some of the reported flooded roads in Pasadena were Vista Street, Shafer Street, Fairmont Drive and Strawberry Road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       304\n",
      "On a warm and dry 22nd of March, 2014, a large landslide occurred four miles east of the town of Oso, Washington. The slide debris, traveling at over 60 miles per hour, crossed the entire river valley, covering an area of over a square mile with an approximate deposit thickness of 15 to 75 feet in some areas. The force of the slide flow caused 43 fatalities, 12 injuries, destroyed 37 homes, and wiped out SR 530 for over a mile. In addition, the slide debris completely blocked the North Fork Stillaguamish River for over 24 hours, backing up a pool of water that flooded the valley about 2 miles upstream and reached approximately 20 feet deep, inundating an additional 6 homes. The cause of the slide is not fully known, though precipitation in the previous months to years contributed to the ground failure. A rain gage located 2 miles west of the slide had 19.93 inches of rain in the 40 days leading up to the slide. |As of March 19th the nearest reporting station Arlington, had reported 7.14 inches of rain, which is about 2 inches shy of the record 9.23 for the entire month of March.  Three days before the slide, the area received close to an inch of rain in one day. Most all of the fatalities occurred at the permanent homes impacted by the slide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    172\n",
      "Unprecedented flash flooding occurred across large parts of Greenbrier County but especially in a swath across the central part of the county where an estimated 6 to 10 inches of rain fell in less than 12 hours. The first flood-related report was received at 100 PM EDT (1200 PM EST) as a portion of Highway 20 in western Greenbrier County became impassable south of Quinwood due to a mudslide and debris in the road. By 130 PM (1230 EST) there were several reports of flash flooding in the community of Rupert which required the evacuation of a nursing home and a vehicle rescue. Portions of Route 60 were closed between Rainelle and Rupert and severe flash flooding occurred along Big Clear Creek, a tributary of the Meadow River just north of Rupert. A number of homes of homes were badly damaged or destroyed along Big Clear Creek and several water rescues required in the Rupert area. The first flooding reports out of Rainelle in far western Greenbrier County were received at 155 PM (1255 EDT) and described people being trapped in cars and numerous water rescues. Several creeks emerge from the higher terrain surrounding Rainelle and converge in or near the town (Wolfpen Creek, Boggs Creek, Little Sewell Creek), the largest of which is Sewell Creek which then joins the Meadow River just northeast of town. The IFLOWS gage on the Meadow River near Hines (HNEW2) rose rapidly above its Flood Stage of 14 feet by 200 PM EDT and reached Major Flood Stage of 18 feet just two hours later, shortly before it ceased functioning at a stage of 18.8 feet while still rising. Flooding along the Meadow River was extensive with numerous homes and businesses affected. In addition, the rising Meadow River prevented Sewell Creek in Rainelle from discharging into the Meadow River which likely contributed to the rapidly rising water levels in Rainelle. Flooding was catastrophic in the town with water up to 8 feet deep or more and numerous homes flooded. There were four fatalities in Rainelle and three in Rupert, all due to asphyxiation (drowning). ||Meanwhile, numerous flood reports continued to be received although the 911 center and Emergency Management were completely overwhelmed with calls. The Greenbrier County Sheriff described 'complete chaos' across the county in a media report as dozens of roads were closed, damaged or destroyed and many water rescues were made from cars and structures. Especially hard hit was the White Sulphur Springs area in the eastern part of the county. Several small streams also descend rapidly from higher surrounding terrain and converge in or near White Sulphur Springs including Dry Creek and Wades Creek which join Howard Creek in the town, which itself is a large tributary of the Greenbrier River. All were transformed into raging torrents which tore through parts of the town taking trees, cars and even homes downstream. One of the more horrifying images was of a burning home being carried downstream on Howard Creek before colliding with a bridge. This creek runs through portions of the famous Greenbrier Resort and images of the normally tranquil stream converted into a massive river covering portions of the golf course were widely shared on social and conventional media. Howard Creek flooded long stretches of U.S. Highway 60 downstream of White Sulphur Springs, causing severe damage all along the way to its confluence with the Greenbrier River at Caldwell, six miles downstream. Parts of Route 60 were essentially destroyed and probably dozens of cars were swept into the creek and deposited along the way. There were seven fatalities in and around the White Sulphur Springs area, all but one from drowning. One person's body was found some 30 miles downstream on the Greenbrier River from where she was believed to have been swept into a creek that feeds the river. The body of a teenage girl from White Sulphur Springs was not found for over 6 weeks, eventually winding up in the Caldwell area on the Greenbrier River. There was significant flooding all along the Greenbrier River with Caldwell, Ronceverte and Alderson the hardest hit as the river rose at near flash-flood rates and crested in the Major Flood category (see Episode for details). Numerous homes were flooded in the town of Alderson (Pop: 1184), according to the Mayor. A state of emergency was declared for a number of counties in West Virginia during and after the event and a Major Federal Disaster for over  dozen counties was declared on June 25, 2016 by the President of the U.S. Fatalities in the county totaled 15 with an unknown number of injuries. There was over $5.5 million in public road/bridge damage in Greenbrier County and substantial damage to private roads and bridges. Preliminary data showed 319 homes destroyed and 353 damaged across the county, mostly in the Rainelle and White Sulphur Springs areas. In addition, 12 businesses were destroyed and 20 damaged along with numerous motor vehicles destroyed. Final damage totals for the event are not available from Emergency Management officials as of this writing but an estimate $40 million may not be unreasonable.     96\n",
      "Intense rainfall generated a large and deadly mud and debris flow in the community of Montecito, around the burn scar of the Thomas fire.

      "SC Dept of Natural Resources reported a likely weather-related fatality on Lake Marion. Six people were on a 30 foot pontoon boat heading to a landing at Lake Marion Resort and Marina in Orangeburg Co when strong winds, and waves estimated at 3 to 4 feet, associated with nearby thunderstorms, caused the boat to overturn.  Five people were able to get out from underneath the boat but the sixth boater, a 59 year old male, was found unconscious and later pronounced dead.  Two dogs were also lost.

Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jackson's area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds. Flash flooding also occurred across many areas leading to road closures. The severe weather and cold front finally cleared Mississippi by early Christmas evening.\",\n",

      " 'An anomalously dynamic upper level system caused a rare severe weather outbreak during the afternoon and evening hours of December 14th. This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front. ||Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.   ||As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads. ||Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot���s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).||As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0. ||By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.',\n",

From the 21st through 26th of December, heavy rain, gusty winds, flooding, and mudslides occurred across the Bay Area in these consecutive events. Downed trees, powerlines, and flooded roadways impacted residents over the Christmas holiday season.

The tornado quickly intensified as it approached the southwest corner of Holton, reaching EF1 to EF2 intensity. The path of the tornado moved nearly parallel to the north side of Highway 50 as it moved through Holton. Many of the homes and businesses east of Marion Street were damaged by EF2 intensity winds. The tornado then strengthened to low end EF3 intensity as it moved near the intersection of Highway 50 and Versailles Street. At this point, two fatalities occurred in a mobile home. Six injuries were also reported in the town of Holton. One of the individuals injured died many months later as a result of his injuries, bringing the total number of fatalities from this tornado to 3. This tornado then continued to the northeast from this point at high end EF2, low end EF3 intensity, damaging homes on Sleepy Road and Old Michigan Road. The tornado began to decrease in intensity east of Old Michigan Road and maintained EF1 intensity until it dissipated approximately one mile southeast of Osgood on Finks Road. Several homes and farms had minor damage along the track between Old Michigan Road and the end of the tornado track. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of this tornado was estimated at 145 miles per hour.',\n",
      " 'The tornado touched down in Grant County at 1623 EST, causing low to mid EF3 damage specifically in the Harvesters Subdivision. This damage occurred at the west end of Barley Circle. Most of the damage in the rest of the subdivision was EF1 to EF2. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of this tornado while in Grant County was estimated at 145 miles per hour. After traveling 1.33 miles on the ground in Grant County, the tornado then crossed into Kenton County at 1624 EST. Immediately as the tornado crossed west to east of Interstate 75, it strengthened to EF4 level. Five single family homes were destroyed down to their foundations in this area, with at least two of these homes having strapping or bolting to their foundations. The EF4 damage continued to the north end of Lexington Pike, where 2 homes and multiple outbuildings were completely destroyed. Both homes were brick structures with foundation bolting or strapping. The EF4 winds continued across Route 25 and ended near the Bagby Road area. At least 2 vehicles were carried, with one carried over 1800 feet. Trees were stripped of nearly all branches, with much of the bark also stripped. All 4 fatalities with this tornado occurred within the area of EF4 damage. As the tornado headed further to the east northeast, high end EF3 damage continued through other properties along Bagby Road, to Carlisle, Parker Grove, and Paxton Roads. Numerous double and single wide homes were destroyed, with both brick and siding structures left with collapsed exterior walls and either all or a large percentage of the roof removed. The tornado continued the east northeast path into southeast Kenton County, to the Licking River near Morning View. Damage in the Morning View area was consistent with EF1 to EF2 damage to near the Campbell County line, where the tornado lifted at 1632 EST after traveling 8.52 miles in Kenton County. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed from this tornado while in Kenton County was estimated at 175 miles per hour. This storm produced an earlier tornado in southern Indiana. Debris, possibly from that tornado, was later observed falling from the sky across Boone County, Kentucky.',\n",

The tornado then crossed into Pendleton County at 1641 EST after producing high end EF3 damage along Reid Ridge Road near the Campbell and Pendleton County line. The tornado then moved across Mays Road producing significant and widespread EF2 to low end EF3 damage. The tornado then crossed AA highway and eventually the Ohio River, after crossing Kentucky Highway 8. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of the tornado was estimated to be 160 miles per hour in Campbell County and 140 miles per hour in Pendleton County. The tornado traveled a total of 2.68 miles in Campbell County, and 4 miles in Pendleton County. The tornado then moved into Clermont County Ohio at 1646 EST, where it hit the town of Moscow, causing EF3 damage. The tornado continued on the ground across Clermont County, crossing into Brown County at 1658 EST. The tornado then lifted south of Hamersville in western Brown County at 1702 EST. This tornado caused extensive damage to structures and trees along its entire path on both sides of the Ohio River. Numerous homes were very heavily damaged or destroyed. Many homes lost their roofs, having complete exterior wall failure. Some modular homes were completely removed from their foundations, lifted, and thrown in excess of 100 yards where they were destroyed. The damage in Ohio from this tornado was consistent with maximum winds estimated at 160 miles per hour in Clermont County, and 100 miles per hour in Brown County. The tornado traveled a total of 11.04 miles in Clermont County, and 2.69 miles in Brown County.',\n",

    "One of the three algorithms that we implemented was a Random Forest Regressor; we chose to implement a Random Forest Regressor and not a Random Forest Classifier because the variable we were trying to predict (\"DAMAGE_PROPERTY\") represented a numerical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One hyperparameter that we decided to tune was \"n_estimators,\" which indicates the number of trees included in the model. Specifically, we trained the model with 500 trees, 100 trees, and 50 trees, and the differing numbers of trees had an influence on the two metrics we used to gauge the performance of the model: mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE can be defined as the mean or average of the square of the difference between actual values and estimated values. MSE can be used to find a line-of-best-fit, however it is sensitive to outliers. The larger the MSE, the farther that estimated values are from their actual counterparts; the smaller the MSE, the better that the estimated values resemble the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of determination (also called r-squared) determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (the variable representative of the y-axis) that can be explained by the independent variable (the variable representative of the x-axis). In other words, the coefficient of determination indicates how well the data fits the model. The closer the r-squared value is to 1, the more of an indication that the data is a good fit for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with the implementation of the Random Forest Regressor with 500 trees, the MSE was roughly 31,336,158,626,093.75, while the r-squared value was roughly 0.9996. Although the r-squared value being high is a good thing, the same cannot be said for the MSE, however this was the first implementation of the model, so there was room for improvement. Thus \"n_estimators\" was changed to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the implementation of the model with 100 trees, the MSE was roughly 35,693,091,472,187.5, while the r-squared value was roughly 0.9995. Both the MSE and the r-squared value for this implementation of the model were worse than the MSE and the r-squared value for the implementation of the model with 500 trees, thus \"n_estimators\" was once again tuned, this time to 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the implementation of the model with 50 trees, the MSE was roughly 29,200,251,705,625.0, while the r-squared value was roughly 0.9995. This MSE value was better than the previous two MSE values, however it is still considerably high; this r-squared value was consistent with the previous two r-squared values. Overall, the high MSE for each of the three models is an indication that a Random Forest Regressor may not be the best model for predicting \"DAMAGE_PROPERTY\" from tornadoes based on \"INJURIES_DIRECT,\" \"DEATHS_DIRECT,\" \"TOR_F_SCALE,\" \"TOR_LENGTH,\" \"TOR_WIDTH,\" \"BEGIN_MONTH,\" and \"END_MONTH.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, looking at the horizontal bar chart above, it illustrates which features were most important in predicting \"DAMAGE_PROPERTY.\" As one can see, the top three features were \"DEATHS_DIRECT,\" \"INJURIES_DIRECT,\" and \"TOR_LENGTH,\" with relative importance scores of roughly 0.52, 0.38, and 0.068, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note: Although it is customary to round all numeric calculations to 2 decimal places, had we done this for the coefficient of determination values for the three different implementations of the Random Forest Regressor, we wouldn't have been able to differentiate between the performances of the implementations.***"

We tested k values of 1 to 30 for a total of 29 k values, and measured model performance using MSE and coefficient of determination (both as described above). \n",

    "The KNN regression model performed best with a k value of 2, which had the highest R-squared value (0.85), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. This model had a large MSE (2.12e+15; greater than the top performing random forest model); however, the property damage data had a wide spread/variance, which could account for the large mean square error. Given the large MSE value and lower R-squared value compared to other algorithms, it can be concluded that this model is not optimal for predicting tornado property damages. Additionally, the difference between test and training scores suggest the possibility of overfitting. \n",

The MSE value was once again very large (3.02e+16) — indeed, larger than both of the other models tested. The coefficient of determination was low as well (0.09), indicating that the multiple linear regression was not a good fit for the data. This suggested that the model was not the best choice for predicting tornado damages based on the input features. \n",

    "Additionally, based on analysis of the feature coefficients, the most influential features were F scale ratings of 4 (positive correlation value) and 2 (negative correlation value).    "

    "Taking all three algorithms that we implemented into account, we conclude that the best algorithm was the Random Forest Regressor, specifically with 50 trees. Although the K Neighbors Regressor with 2 neighbors had the highest coefficient of determination with 0.9998, the Random Forest Regressor with 50 trees had both the second-highest coefficient of determination of 0.9996 and the smallest MSE of 29,143,515,948,750.00.\n",

    "The r-squared value being as close to 1 as it is signifies that the data is a considerably good fit for the model. Additionally, although the MSE is considerably large, the fact that the Random Forest Regressor with 50 trees has the smallest MSE signifies that the estimated values for property damage from tornadoes best resemble the actual values in the data relative to this model."
